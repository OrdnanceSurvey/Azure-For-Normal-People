# Azure for "Normal" People - working documentation

Azure for "Normal" People is the title of a workshop, first devised and delivered at the Ordnance Survey in 2018. It was born from a train journey, on which one of our Delivery Managers told one of our Engineers something like: "I wish there was an introduction to Azure, for non-technical people, so I can understand what's going on".
The resulting workshop grew to cover much more than just Azure, and took non-technial stakeholders on a journey through the development practices by which software products are developed and delivered at the Ordnance Survey.

The workshop introduces technical concepts, and makes a shared langauge accesible to non-technial stakeholders.
Participants build, with their own hands, a paper representation of a system deployed into the cloud. 

The original workshop was targeted against Microsoft Azure, but the whole concept is pretty tech agnostic.


## A note on expectation management:
We don't think you'll be able to meaningfully lift and shift this into your own workplace. You'll need to do some work and adaptation. We're proving you with a tried and tested worked example of a approach - you'll need to make your own contextualised version of it. In this repo, you will find resources we hope will help.

**This repo is a work in progress**, and is offered as is. We hope that you'll get in touch if we decide to run a variant of the workshop, and let us know how you get on. If you develop something, we hope you'll consider contributing back to the repo for everyone else.

# What's in the repo

## Generic resources. 
### Scenario and Narrative
The scenario and narrative for your workshop are the most important things. In our experience, once you get that right, everything else will just fall out. Accordingly, the scenario and narrative are probably the hardest things to construct! They need to:
* be specific enough to your audience that your audience will be able to relate to them, and 
* have the right elements such that the story generates the problems and needs that the processes and tools will satisfy.  
    This is tricky, so you will find some guidance on how to craft a scenario and narrative that will fit a flow similar to our example.
    
### Metaphors
You'll details of the metaphors we've found particularly effective for explaining concepts like Authentication and Authorisation to non-technical stakeholders. Because these are metaphors for generic concepts, they're generally applicable no matter what your platform.
	
## Azure specific resources
You'll find a PowerPoint that has printable items for Azure resources that are commonly used at the Ordnance Survey. If you're a Microsoft house, you might be able to print and play with these. If you're with another provider, you can replace the graphics with their equivalents from AWS or what ever platform your using.
	
## Our worked example
This consists of our presentation, which goes with our Script. Our script comes from our notes, which we've neatened up and expanded upon for your reference.
	
We've also included the A3 worksheet we offer to our participants, with fill in the blank slots. The worksheet shows a similar (but not identical) set up to what they build. We don't prescribe use of the worksheets, but we do make them available from the start, and display the model answers at the end. In our experience, almost every participant fills them in in the session. The reverse of the sheet has most of the important icons, with space for the participants to write their own notes.
